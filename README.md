## Current state
At the moment Fjord is at the state where it's as simple as an engine could possibly be. It has some basic editor that allows you to create and save scenes, add and delete entities and their components. If you want more details about development process you could get them at the [Trello Desc](https://trello.com/b/oDJWidax/engine)
